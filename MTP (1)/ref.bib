Prediction and analysis of stock market data have got an important role in today’s economy. The various algorithms used for forecasting can be categorized into linear (AR, MA, ARIMA, ARMA) and non-linear models (ARCH, GARCH, Neural Network). In this paper, we are using four types of deep learning architectures i.e Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting the stock price of a company based on the historical prices available. Here we are using day-wise closing price of two different stock markets, National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The network was trained with the stock price of a single company from NSE and predicted for five different companies from both NSE and NYSE. It has been observed that CNN is outperforming the other models. The network was able to predict for NYSE even though it was trained with NSE data. This was possible because both the stock markets share some common inner dynamics. The results obtained were com- pared with ARIMA model and it has been observed that the neural networks are outperforming the existing linear model (ARIMA).},

The intensity of the news chatter on various aspects of the pandemic, in conjunction with the sentiment of the same, accounts for the uncertainty of investors linked to financial markets. In this research, Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven frameworks have been propounded to gauge the proliferation of COVID-19 news towards Indian stock markets through the lens of predictive modelling. Two hybrid predictive frameworks, UMAP-LSTM and ISOMAP-GBR, have been constructed to accurately forecast the daily stock prices of 10 Indian companies of different industry verticals using several systematic media chatter indices related to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside several orthodox technical indicators and macroeconomic variables. The outcome of the rigorous predictive exercise rationalizes the utility of monitoring relevant media news worldwide and in India. Additional model interpretation using Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies indicates that a high quantum of overall media hype, media coverage, fake news, etc., leads to bearish market regimes.},

  abstract  = {Market liquidity ensures the marketability of security and is an indispensable feature of stock markets. Previous studies have emphasized the role of stock market liquidity in empirical finance. However, they have inadequately explored its multidimensional nature. This study eliminates the ambiguities related to market liquidity by precisely measuring it by using popular and proven liquidity measures. As such, the present study aims to evaluate market liquidity in terms of depth, breadth, tightness, and immediacy in the Indian equity market and also identifies crucial interdependencies between liquidity dimensions. The study selects 500 stocks constituting the NIFTY 500 index of the National Stock Exchange, India, as of 26th May 2019. The data on trading volume, bid price, ask price, the number of shares outstanding, closing share prices were retrieved for the period from 1st April 2009 to 31st March 2019. The study employs Share Turnover, Amihud Illiquidity Ratio, Relative Quoted Spreads, and Coefficient of Elasticity of Trading for liquidity measurement. The Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model is used to establish the simultaneous relationships between liquidity dimensions. The analysis is conducted at the aggregate market level as well as across turnover based stock groups divided based on their rankings in terms of stock specific share turnover. The empirical results evidenced the presence of consistent depth, strong breadth, and immediacy but lower tightness in the Indian equity market. The market depth and tightness appear to be relevant in determining dimensional interdependencies. Also, less frequently traded stocks exhibit higher illiquidity in the wake of lower tightness. The findings of this study will assist the investors to wisely understand the multifaceted nature of market liquidity and base their trading decisions accordingly. Moreover, the regulators of the stock exchange can devise liquidity enhancing policies based on the directional movements among liquidity dimensions.},

The purpose of the study is to determine how market-related financial variables such as earnings per share (EPS), dividend per share (DPS), and book value per share (BVPS) affect the market price of equity shares of companies included in the S\&P BSE-30 index from 2015-16 through 2021-22. Panel regression analysis has been employed to evaluate the data. In panel data regression models appropriateness of model among ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effect (FE) and random effect (RE) has been checked. F-statistics and Hausman results inferred that FE is preferable to RE and OLS. Results revealed that all the financial variables are having positive and significant impact on the market price of equity shares. © 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

  abstract  = {Using a dummy variable, we evaluate commodities in addition to macroeconomic considerations of the Indian securities market from 2010 to 2021, which includes the era of the Covid 19 crises. We used the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) (Sensex) for securities market performance and developed a Vector Auto regressive models that combines the short- and long-run model of economics. On stock price indexes, we discovered that the Indian securities market reflects both macroeconomic indicators and prices of commodity. Growth in the economy, inflation, interest, rates, currency rates, crude oil prices, and gold prices are all factors to consider were all used in this study to see how they affected BSE (Sensex) prices during the Covid 19 crises. In their first difference, all series were judged to be stationary. We discovered that shocks to all eight factors had both positive and negative effects on BSE (Sensex) prices in the short and long term, including Covid 19 crises. Each securities market index’s most significant impulse is its own shock, decreasing from short to long-term. We also used the Joint Co-Integration Test to detect and confirm the lack of a long-term equilibrium link (cointegration) between all eight variables, resulting in four cointegration equations with an estimated error correction term at the 0.05 level (speed of adjustment towards equilibrium) of 0.007362. Vector Error Correction Mode (VECM), on the other hand, suggests that the BSE (Sensex) has a significant value with its lagged values of.007362 and 0.517952. We created Vector Auto regressive (VAR) models for the BSE (Sensex) using eight independent variables, including Dummy variables, but their statistics were not significant, despite the fact that the lagged value of crude oil, gold prices, the rupee, and the BSE (Sensex) lagged value were all significant. We proceed to estimate VECM. We proved the short and long-term effects of lagged BSE(Sensex) prices, crude oil prices, gold prices, and the currency on the BSE (SENSEX) using several robustness tests. Dummy factors have also been included to see how the Covid 19 crisis affected the BSE (Sensex) prices. We discovered that crude oil prices followed value, gold prices lagged value, and rupees based on the dollar had a significant impact on BSE(Sensex) pricing over the study period, including the Covid 19 crises from March 2020 to June 2021.},

A comparison is drawn between the Most Diversified portfolio (MD) and three alternatives; a Minimum Variance portfolio, an Equally-Weighted portfolio and a Tangent (or Maximum Sharpe ratio) portfolio. The aim is to assess portfolio performance using cumulative returns, the Sharpe ratio and the daily volatilities of each portfolio. The four asset allocation methods are governed by multiple constraints. Although previous work has shown that MD portfolios exhibit greater diversification and a higher Sharpe ratio than other investment strategies, this was not found using developed market index data.},

  abstract  = {After the 2008 financial crisis, risk management has become more important than performance management and an alternative portfolio design, referred to as risk parity portfolio, has been receiving significant attention from both theoretical and practical fields due to its advantage in diversification of (ex-ante) risk contributions among assets. Usually, this approach results in a portfolio with nonzero weights in all the assets. Investors, however, could not lay out the capital among all the assets listed on the markets, which results in unrealistically high transaction costs, and therefore, reduction of the return of the designed portfolio. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose a method to jointly select only some of the assets and distribute the capital among the selected assets such that the risk is diversified enough.},

Numerical experiments using the historical data of NIKKEI 225 stocks show that the L1 risk model generates a portfolio quite similar to that of the Markowitz's model within a fraction of time required to solve the latter.},

The purpose is to consider parameter uncertainty by controlling the impact of estimation errors on the portfolio strategy performance. We construct a simple robust mean absolute deviation (RMAD) model which leads to a linear program and reduces computational complexity of existing robust portfolio optimization methods. This paper tests the robust strategies on real market data and discusses performance of the robust optimization model empirically based on financial elasticity, standard deviation, and market condition such as growth, steady state, and decline in trend. Our study shows that the proposed robust optimization generally outperforms a nominal mean absolute deviation model. We also suggest precautions against use of robust optimization under certain circumstances.},

In many cases, the return rate of risky asset is neither a random variable nor a fuzzy variable. Then, it can be described as an uncertain variable. But, the existing works on uncertain portfolio optimization problem fail to find an analytic solution of optimal portfolio strategy. In this paper, we define a new uncertain risk measure for the modeling of investment risk. Then, an uncertain portfolio optimization model is formulated. By introducing a new variable, we transform it into an equivalent bi-criteria optimization model. Then, we derive a method for the construction of the set of analytic Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, a numerical simulation is carried out to show the applicability of the proposed model and the convenience of finding the analytic solution.},

The Sortino, omega, and kappa ratios provide credible, workable single-factor measures of financial dispersion below mean return. At a minimum, specifying these ratios provides a useful contrast with conventional, two-tailed measures such as the Sharpe and Treynor ratios. Because it is based on downside semideviation, the square root of the lower partial second moment, the Sortino ratio is particularly easy to reconcile with the more traditional and more familiar tools of modern portfolio theory. Indeed, closer examination of the Sortino ratio reveals Pythagorean relationships between single-sided risk measures and their counterparts within the conventional capital asset pricing model (CAPM). These relationships allow single-sided measures of volatility to be evaluated with trigonometric tools.},

Deep architectures have been shown to appropriately learn correlation structures in time series data. This paper compares the effectiveness of a deep feedforward Neural Network (DNN) and shallow architectures (e.g., Support Vector Machine (SVM) and one-layer NN) when predicting a broad cross-section of stock price indices in both developed and emerging markets. An extensive evaluation is undertaken, using daily, hourly, minute and tick level data related to thirty-four financial indices from 32 countries across six years. Our evaluation results show a considerable advantage from training deep (cf. shallow) architectures, using a rectifier linear (RELU) activation function, across all thirty-four markets when ‘minute’ data is used. However, the predictive performance of DNN was not significantly better than that of shallower architectures when using tick level data. This result suggests that when training a DNN algorithm, the predictive accuracy peaks, regardless of training size. We also examine which activation function works best for stock price index data. Our results demonstrate that the RELU activation function performs better than TANH across all markets and time horizons when using DNN to predict stock price indices.},

Moreover existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches fail to provide encouraging results. Meanwhile advances in machine learning have presented favourable results for speech recognition, image classification and language processing. Methods applied in digital signal processing can be applied to stock data as both are time series. Similarly, learning outcome of this paper can be applied to speech time series data. Deep learning for stock prediction has been introduced in this paper and its performance is evaluated on Google stock price multimedia data (chart) from NASDAQ. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that deep learning can improve stock market forecasting accuracy. For this, (2D)2PCA + Deep Neural Network (DNN) method is compared with state of the art method 2-Directional 2-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2D)2PCA + Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). It is found that the proposed method is performing better than the existing method RBFNN with an improved accuracy of 4.8% for Hit Rate with a window size of 20. Also the results of the proposed model are compared with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and it is found that the accuracy for Hit Rate is improved by 15.6%. The correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted return for DNN is 17.1% more than RBFNN and it is 43.4% better than RNN.},

Among other modern tools, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been applied for automatic feature selection and market prediction. However, in experiments reported so far, less attention has been paid to the correlation among different markets as a possible source of information for extracting features. In this paper, we suggest a CNN-based framework, that can be applied on a collection of data from a variety of sources, including different markets, in order to extract features for predicting the future of those markets. The suggested framework has been applied for predicting the next day’s direction of movement for the indices of S\&P 500, NASDAQ, DJI, NYSE, and RUSSELL based on various sets of initial variables.

  abstract   = {Computational intelligence techniques for financial trading systems have always been quite popular. In the last decade, deep learning models start getting more attention, especially within the image processing community. In this study, we propose a novel algorithmic trading model CNN-TA using a 2-D convolutional neural network based on image processing properties. In order to convert financial time series into 2-D images, 15 different technical indicators each with different parameter selections are utilized. Each indicator instance generates data for a 15 day period. As a result, 15 × 15 sized 2-D images are constructed. Each image is then labeled as Buy, Sell or Hold depending on the hills and valleys of the original time series. The results indicate that when compared with the Buy \& Hold Strategy and other common trading systems over a long out-of-sample period, the trained model provides better results for stocks and ETFs.},

The purpose of this paper is to benchmark ensemble methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost and Kernel Factory) against single classifier models (Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbor). We gathered data from 5767 publicly listed European companies and used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a performance measure. Our predictions are one year ahead. The results indicate that Random Forest is the top algorithm followed by Support Vector Machines, Kernel Factory, AdaBoost, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression. This study contributes to literature in that it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to make such an extensive benchmark. The results clearly suggest that novel studies in the domain of stock price direction prediction should include ensembles in their sets of algorithms. Our extensive literature review evidently indicates that this is currently not the case.},

  abstract = {Seasonality effects and empirical regularities in financial data have been well documented in the financial economics literature for over seven decades. This paper proposes an expert system that uses novel machine learning techniques to predict the price return over these seasonal events, and then uses these predictions to develop a profitable trading strategy. While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly.},

  abstract = {As financial time series are inherently noisy and non-stationary, it is regarded as one of the most challenging applications of time series forecasting. Due to the advantages of generalization capability in obtaining a unique solution, support vector regression (SVR) has also been successfully applied in financial time series forecasting. In the modeling of financial time series using SVR, one of the key problems is the inherent high noise. Thus, detecting and removing the noise are important but difficult tasks when building an SVR forecasting model. To alleviate the influence of noise, a two-stage modeling approach using independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector regression is proposed in financial time series forecasting. ICA is a novel statistical signal processing technique that was originally proposed to find the latent source signals from observed mixture signals without having any prior knowledge of the mixing mechanism. The proposed approach first uses ICA to the forecasting variables for generating the independent components (ICs). After identifying and removing the ICs containing the noise, the rest of the ICs are then used to reconstruct the forecasting variables which contain less noise and served as the input variables of the SVR forecasting model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the Nikkei 225 opening index and TAIEX closing index are used as illustrative examples. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the SVR model with non-filtered forecasting variables and a random walk model.},

The empirical results indicate that nonlinear models outperformed linear models on the basis of both statistical and economic criteria. Specifically, although return serial correlation receded by around 10 minutes, return predictability still persisted for up to 60 minutes according to nonlinear models, even though profitability decreases as time elapses. More flexible nonlinear models such as support vector machines and artificial neural network did not clearly outperform other nonlinear models. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Using the daily returns of international ETFs over a period of 14 years, the empirical results show that including return forecasting improves the realized performance due to more efficient asset allocation but not a reduction in trading costs. The models that are based on trade-off between return and volatility, such as the mean-variance and Omega models, show higher increases in performance than those mainly focus on controlling loss, such as the linearized value-at-risk, the conditional value-at-risk, and the downside risk. The superiority of forecasting risky portfolios over the equally-weighted diversification varies intertemporarily across various portfolio models. The benefit of inclusion of prediction is larger when the market is less volatile.},

Many studies on portfolio optimisation assume that short sales are not allowed. This is despite the fact that theoretically, short positions can improve the risk-return characteristics of a portfolio, and practically, institutional investors can and do sell stocks short. We investigate whether removing the non-negativity constraint really improves out-of-sample portfolio performance under realistic assumptions, that is when optimal weights need to be estimated from the data and different transaction costs apply to long and short positions.},

Until recently, the Omega ratio was thought to be computationally intractable, and research was focused on heuristic optimization procedures. We have shown elsewhere that the Omega ratio optimization is equivalent to a linear program and hence can be solved exactly in polynomial time. This permits the investigation of more complex and realistic variants of the problem. The standard formulation of the Omega ratio requires perfect information for the probability distribution of the asset returns. In this paper, we investigate the problem arising from the probability distribution of the asset returns being only partially known. We introduce the robust variant of the conventional Omega ratio that hedges against uncertainty in the probability distribution. We examine the worst-case Omega ratio optimization problem under three types of uncertainty – mixture distribution, box and ellipsoidal uncertainty – and show that the problem remains tractable.},
