\section*{Abstract}
Advancements in machine learning have opened up a wide range of new possibilities for using advanced computer algorithms, such as deep learning in portfolio risk management. However, very little evidence has been provided on the superior performance of deep learning models over traditional optimization models following the mean-variance framework in different financial market settings. This study uses two experiments with data from the Indian and U.S. securities markets to justify whether advanced machine learning models could outperform traditional portfolios' cumulative returns while optimizing the Sharpe ratio.
