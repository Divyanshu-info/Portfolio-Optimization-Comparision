Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux
============================

Riskfolio-lib only supports Python 3.7+ on OS X, Windows, and Linux. I recommend
using pip for installation.

1. It is highly recommendable that you must have installed a scientific Python distribution like `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ or `winpython <https://winpython.github.io>`_ (Windows only).

2. If you don't have installed cvxpy, you must follow `cvxpy <https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html>`_ installation instructions before installing Riskfolio-Lib.

3. If you still have problems installing cvxpy, you can download cvxpy wheel from the `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cvxpy>`_ and install using pip.

  ::

      pip install path/cvxpyâ€‘version.whl


4. Install ``Riskfolio-lib``.

  ::

      pip install riskfolio-lib


5. To run some examples is necessary to install `yfinance <https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/>`_.

  ::

      pip install yfinance
  

6. To run some examples is necessary to install MOSEK, you must follow `MOSEK <https://docs.mosek.com/9.2/install/installation.html>`_ installation instructions. To get a MOSEK license you must go to `Academic Licenses <https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/>`_.
