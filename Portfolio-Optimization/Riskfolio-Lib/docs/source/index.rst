Description
===========

Riskfolio-Lib is a library for making portfolio optimization and quantitative strategic asset allocation in Python made in Peru |:peru:|. Its objective is to help students, academics and practitioners to build investment portfolios based on mathematically complex models with low effort. It is built on top of
`CVXPY <https://www.cvxpy.org/>`_ and closely integrated
with `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ data structures.

Some of key functionalities that Riskfolio-Lib offers:

- Mean Risk and Logarithmic Mean Risk (Kelly Criterion) Portfolio Optimization with 4 objective functions:

    - Minimum Risk.
    - Maximum Return.
    - Maximum Utility Function.
    - Maximum Risk Adjusted Return Ratio.

- Mean Risk and Logarithmic Mean Risk (Kelly Criterion) Portfolio Optimization with 18 convex risk measures:

    **Dispersion Risk Measures:**

    - Standard Deviation.
    - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
    - Gini Mean Difference (GMD).
    - Range.
    - Conditional Value at Risk Range.
    - Tail Gini Range.

    **Downside Risk Measures:**

    - Semi Standard Deviation.
    - First Lower Partial Moment (Omega Ratio).
    - Second Lower Partial Moment (Sortino Ratio).
    - Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
    - Tail Gini.
    - Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR).
    - Worst Case Realization (Minimax).

    **Drawdown Risk Measures:**

    - Maximum Drawdown (Calmar Ratio) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Average Drawdown for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Entropic Drawdown at Risk (EDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Ulcer Index for uncompounded cumulative returns.

- Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization with 14 convex risk measures:

    **Dispersion Risk Measures:**

    - Standard Deviation.
    - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
    - Gini Mean Difference (GMD).
    - Conditional Value at Risk Range.
    - Tail Gini Range.

    **Downside Risk Measures:**

    - Semi Standard Deviation.
    - First Lower Partial Moment (Omega Ratio)
    - Second Lower Partial Moment (Sortino Ratio)
    - Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
    - Tail Gini.
    - Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR).

    **Drawdown Risk Measures:**

    - Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Entropic Drawdown at Risk (EDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Ulcer Index for uncompounded cumulative returns.

- Hierarchical Clustering Portfolio Optimization: Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution (HERC) with 27 risk measures using naive risk parity:

    **Dispersion Risk Measures:**

    - Standard Deviation.
    - Variance.
    - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
    - Gini Mean Difference (GMD).
    - Range.

    - Second Lower Partial Moment (Sortino Ratio).
    - Value at Risk (VaR).
    - Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
    - Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR).
    - Tail Gini.
    - Worst Case Realization (Minimax).

    **Drawdown Risk Measures:**

    - Maximum Drawdown (Calmar Ratio) for compounded and uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Average Drawdown for compounded and uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Drawdown at Risk (DaR) for compounded and uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR) for compounded and uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Entropic Drawdown at Risk (EDaR) for compounded and uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Ulcer Index for compounded and uncompounded cumulative returns.

- Nested Clustered Optimization (NCO) with four objective functions and the available risk measures to each objective:

    - Minimum Risk.
    - Maximum Return.
    - Maximum Utility Function.
    - Equal Risk Contribution.

- Worst Case Mean Variance Portfolio Optimization.
- Relaxed Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization.

- Tools to visualizing portfolio properties and risk measures.
- Tools to build reports on Jupyter Notebook and Excel. 
- Option to use commercial optimization solver like MOSEK or GUROBI for large scale problems.
