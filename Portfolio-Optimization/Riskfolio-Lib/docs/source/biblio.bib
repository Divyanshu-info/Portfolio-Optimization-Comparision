	abstract = {The central message of this article is that no one should use the sample covariance matrix for portfolio optimization. It is subject to estimation error of the kind most likely to perturb a mean-variance optimizer. Instead, a matrix can be obtained from the sample covariance matrix through a transformation called shrinkage. This tends to pull the most extreme coefficients toward more central values, systematically reducing estimation error when it matters most. Statistically, the challenge is to know the optimal shrinkage intensity. Shrinkage reduces portfolio tracking error relative to a benchmark index, and substantially raises the manager{\textquoteright}s realized information ratio.},

  abstract={Applied researchers often test for the difference of the Sharpe ratios of two investment strategies. A very popular tool to this end is the test of Jobson and Korkie [Jobson, J.D. and Korkie, B.M. (1981). Performance hypothesis testing with the Sharpe and Treynor measures. Journal of Finance, 36:889-908], which has been corrected by Memmel [Memmel, C. (2003). Performance hypothesis testing with the Sharpe ratio. Finance Letters, 1:21-23]. Unfortunately, this test is not valid when returns have tails heavier than the normal distribution or are of time series nature. Instead, we propose the use of robust inference methods. In particular, we suggest to construct a studentized time series bootstrap confidence interval for the difference of the Sharpe ratios and to declare the two ratios different if zero is not contained in the obtained interval. This approach has the advantage that one can simply resample from the observed data as opposed to some null-restricted data. A simulation study demonstrates the improved finite sample performance compared to existing methods. In addition, two applications to real data are provided.},

Even though portfolio resampling is a thoughtful heuristic, some features make it difficult to interpret by the inexperienced.},

abstract="This article addresses the problem of finding an optimal allocation of funds among different asset classes in a robust manner when the estimates of the structure of returns are unreliable. Instead of point estimates used in classical mean-variance optimization, moments of returns are described using uncertainty sets that contain all, or most, of their possible realizations. The approach presented here takes a conservative viewpoint and identifies asset mixes that have the best worst-case behavior. Techniques for generating uncertainty sets from historical data are discussed and numerical results that illustrate the stability of robust optimal asset mixes are reported.",

  abstract={High dimensionality comparable to sample size is common in many statistical problems. We examine covariance matrix estimation in the asymptotic framework that the dimensionality p tends to [infinity] as the sample size n increases. Motivated by the Arbitrage Pricing Theory in finance, a multi-factor model is employed to reduce dimensionality and to estimate the covariance matrix. The factors are observable and the number of factors K is allowed to grow with p. We investigate the impact of p and K on the performance of the model-based covariance matrix estimator. Under mild assumptions, we have established convergence rates and asymptotic normality of the model-based estimator. Its performance is compared with that of the sample covariance matrix. We identify situations under which the factor approach increases performance substantially or marginally. The impacts of covariance matrix estimation on optimal portfolio allocation and portfolio risk assessment are studied. The asymptotic results are supported by a thorough simulation study.},

 abstract = {The indifference of many investment practitioners to mean-variance optimization technology, despite its theoretical appeal, is understandable in many cases. The major problem with MV optimization is its tendency to maximize the effects of errors in the input assumptions. Unconstrained MV optimization can yield results that are inferior to those of simple equal-weighting schemes. Nevertheless, MV optimization is superior to many ad hoc techniques in terms of integration of portfolio objectives with client constraints and efficient use of information. Its practical value may be enhanced by the sophisticated adjustment of inputs and the imposition of constraints based on fundamental investment considerations and the importance of priors. The operating principle should be that, to the extent that reliable information is available, it should be included as part of the definition of the optimization procedure.},

 abstract = {We characterize the conditions under which efficient portfolios put small weights on individual assets. These conditions bound mean returns with measures of average absolute covariability between assets. The bounds clarify the relationship between linear asset pricing models and well-diversified efficient portfolios. We argue that the extreme weightings in sample efficient portfolios are due to the dominance of a single factor in equity returns. This makes it easy to diversify on subsets to reduce residual risk, while weighting the subsets to reduce factor risk simultaneously. The latter involves taking extreme positions. This behavior seems unlikely to be attributable to sampling error.},

Unfortunately, many of the inference procedures that have been suggested previously in the applied literature make unreasonable assumptions that do not apply to real-life return data, such as normality and independence over time. We will discuss inference procedures that are asymptotically valid under very general conditions, allowing for heavy tails and time dependence in the return data.

These measures of risk are functionals of the portfolio drawdown (underwater) curve considered in an active portfolio management. For some value of the tolerance parameter Œ≤, the CDaR is defined as the mean of the worst (1 - Œ≤) * 100\% drawdowns. The CDaR risk measure includes the Maximal Drawdown and Average Drawdown as its limiting cases. For a particular example, we find the optimal portfolios for a case of Maximal Drawdown, a case of Average Drawdown, and several intermediate cases between these two. The CDaR family of risk measures is similar to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), which is also called Mean Shortfall, Mean Access loss, or Tail Value-at-Risk. Some recommendations on how to select the optimal risk measure for getting practically stable portfolios are provided. We solved a real life portfolio allocation problem using the proposed measures.},

 abstract = {Quantitative asset allocation models have not played the important role they should in global portfolio management. A good part of the problem is that such models are difficult to use and tend to result in portfolios that are badly behaved. Consideration of the global CAPM equilibrium can significantly improve the usefulness of these models. In particular, equilibrium returns for equities, bonds and currencies provide neutral starting points for estimating the set of expected excess returns needed to drive the portfolio optimization process. This set of neutral weights can then be tilted in accordance with the investor's views. If the investor has no particular views about asset returns, he can use the neutral values given by the equilibrium model. If the investor does have one or more views about the relative performances of assets, or their absolute performances, he can adjust equilibrium values in accordance with those views. Furthermore, the investor can control how strongly a particular view influences portfolio weights, in accordance with the degree of confidence with which he holds the view.},

HRP applies modern mathematics (graph theory and machine-learning techniques) to build a diversified portfolio based on the information contained in the covariance matrix. However, unlike quadratic optimizers, HRP does not require the invertibility of the covariance matrix. In fact, HRP can compute a portfolio on an ill-degenerated or even a singular covariance matrix{\textemdash}an impossible feat for quadratic optimizers. Monte Carlo experiments show that HRP delivers lower out-ofsample variance than CLA, even though minimum variance is CLA{\textquoteright}s optimization objective. HRP also produces less risky portfolios out of sample compared to traditional risk parity methods.},

This is achieved by building topologically embedded networks containing the subset of most significant links and analyzing the network structure. For a planar embedding, this method provides both the intra-cluster hierarchy, which describes the way clusters are composed, and the inter-cluster hierarchy which describes how clusters gather together. We discuss performance, robustness and reliability of this method by first investigating several artificial data-sets, finding that it can outperform significantly other established approaches. Then we show that our method can successfully differentiate meaningful clusters and hierarchies in a variety of real data-sets. In particular, we find that the application to gene expression patterns of lymphoma samples uncovers biologically significant groups of genes which play key-roles in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of some of the most relevant human lymphoid malignancies.},

We demonstrate that G is the union of a set of special subgraphs, named ‚Äòbubbles‚Äô, that are themselves maximal planar graphs. The graph G is retrieved by connecting these bubbles in a tree structure where neighboring bubbles are joined together by a 3-clique. Bubbles naturally provide the subdivision of G into communities and the tree structure defines the hierarchical relations between these communities.}

  abstract={Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) is a risk-based portfolio optimisation algorithm, which has been shown to generate diversified portfolios with robust out-of-sample properties without the need for a positive-definite return covariance matrix (Lopez de Prado 2016). The algorithm applies machine learning techniques to identify the underlying hierarchical correlation structure of the portfolio, allowing clusters of similar assets to compete for capital. The resulting allocation is both well-diversified over risk sources and intuitively appealing. This paper proposes a method of fully exploiting the information created by the clustering process, achieving enhanced out-of-sample risk and return characteristics. In addition, a practical approach to calculating HRP weights under box and group constraints is introduced. A comprehensive set of portfolio simulations over 6 equity universes demonstrates the appeal of the algorithm for portfolios consisting of 20 - 200 assets. HRP delivers highly diversified allocations with low volatility, low portfolio turnover and competitive performance metrics.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper formulates a relaxed risk parity optimization model to control the balance of risk parity violation against the total portfolio performance. Risk parity has been criticized as being overly conservative and it is improved by re-introducing the asset expected returns into the model and permitting the portfolio to violate the risk parity condition. This paper proposes the incorporation of an explicit target return goal with an intuitive target return approach into a second-order-cone model of a risk parity optimization. When the target return is greater than risk parity return, a violation to risk parity allocations occurs that is controlled using a computational construct to obtain near-risk parity portfolios to retain as much risk parity-like traits as possible. This model is used to demonstrate empirically that higher returns can be achieved than risk parity without the risk contributions deviating dramatically from the risk parity allocations. Furthermore, this study reveals that the relaxed risk parity model exhibits advantageous traits of robustness to expected returns, which should not deter the use of expected returns in risk parity model.},

  abstract={This article develops the theory of risk budgeting portfolios, when we would like to impose weight constraints. It appears that the mathematical problem is more complex than the traditional risk budgeting problem. The formulation of the optimization program is particularly critical in order to determine the right risk budgeting portfolio. We also show that numerical solutions can be found using methods that are used in large-scale machine learning problems. Indeed, we develop an algorithm that mixes the method of cyclical coordinate descent (CCD), alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), proximal operators and Dykstra's algorithm. This theoretical body is then applied to some investment problems. In particular, we show how to dynamically control the turnover of a risk parity portfolio and how to build smart beta portfolios based on the ERC approach by improving the liquidity of the portfolio or reducing the small cap bias. Finally, we highlight the importance of the homogeneity property of risk measures and discuss the related scaling puzzle.},
