## Description

Riskfolio-Lib is a library for making quantitative strategic asset allocation
or portfolio optimization in Python made in Peru &#x1F1F5;&#x1F1EA;. Its objective is to help students, academics and practitioners to build investment portfolios based on mathematically complex models with low effort. It is built on top of
[cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) and closely integrated
with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data structures.

Some of key functionalities that Riskfolio-Lib offers:

- Mean Risk and Logarithmic Mean Risk (Kelly Criterion) Portfolio Optimization with 4 objective functions:

    - Minimum Risk.
    - Maximum Return.
    - Maximum Utility Function.
    - Maximum Risk Adjusted Return Ratio.

- Mean Risk and Logarithmic Mean Risk (Kelly Criterion) Portfolio Optimization with 18 convex risk measures:

    **Dispersion Risk Measures:**

    - Standard Deviation.
    - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
    - Gini Mean Difference (GMD).
    - Range.
    - Conditional Value at Risk Range.
    - Tail Gini Range.
    &nbsp;
    
    **Downside Risk Measures:**

    - Semi Standard Deviation.
    - First Lower Partial Moment (Omega Ratio).
    - Second Lower Partial Moment (Sortino Ratio).

    - Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Entropic Drawdown at Risk (EDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Ulcer Index for uncompounded cumulative returns.

- Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization with 14 convex risk measures:

    **Dispersion Risk Measures:**

    - Standard Deviation.
    - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
    - Gini Mean Difference (GMD).
    - Conditional Value at Risk Range.
    - Tail Gini Range.
    &nbsp;
    
    **Downside Risk Measures:**

    - Second Lower Partial Moment (Sortino Ratio)
    - Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
    - Tail Gini.
    - Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR).
    &nbsp;
    
    **Drawdown Risk Measures:**

    - Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Entropic Drawdown at Risk (EDaR) for uncompounded cumulative returns.
    - Ulcer Index for uncompounded cumulative returns.

- Hierarchical Clustering Portfolio Optimization: Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution (HERC) with 22 risk measures using naive risk parity:

    **Dispersion Risk Measures:**

    - Variance.
    - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
    - Range.

    - Tail Gini.
    - Worst Case Realization (Minimax).
    &nbsp;
    
    **Drawdown Risk Measures:**

    - Maximum Drawdown (Calmar Ratio) for compounded and uncompounded cumulative returns.

## RoadMap

The plan for this module is to add more functions that will be very useful
to asset managers.

- Add more functions based on suggestion of users.
